Keep in mind that PayPal related ratings don\'t mean anything until about 30 days since that\'s how long it often takes the owner of a stolen account to find out about it. If you trade I encourage you to record the amount traded and the PayPal email used. If later on he sends from a different PP account it\'s probably a stolen one.
